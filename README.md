# Bulma Portfolio

## About

A project in UofO Coding Bootcamp was to update our first portfolios with our new found bootstrap knowledge. I chose Bulma and had a lot of fun making tweaks and seeing what worked best for my page and me. I like minimal because I feel it still has a way to stand out on it's own.
